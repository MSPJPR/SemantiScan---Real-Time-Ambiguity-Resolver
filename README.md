Project Name:

SemantiScan– Real-Time Ambiguity Resolver

 Objective:

The goal of this project is to create a real-time web-based tool that detects and resolves lexical and structural ambiguities in a given text. It provides immediate feedback and explanations to help users understand ambiguities and improve the clarity of their writing.

 Key Features

1. Lexical Ambiguity Detection:

Identifies words with multiple meanings (e.g., bat, bank, lead).

Provides tooltips explaining each possible meaning.



2. Structural Ambiguity Detection:

Detects potential ambiguities related to sentence structure (e.g., prepositional phrase attachments).

Offers explanations for the detected structural ambiguity patterns.



3. History Feature:

Stores previously analyzed sentences.

Allows users to click on past entries to reanalyze the text quickly.



4. Export Functionality:

Enables users to export the analysis results as a .txt file for offline use.



5. User-Friendly Interface:

Simple layout with textarea input, buttons, and a results display area.

Clear and concise design using CSS for an intuitive experience.

 Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the web page.

CSS: For styling and layout.

JavaScript: For real-time analysis and interaction.

Termux: To develop and run the project on a mobile device.

Project Workflow

1. Input:
The user types a sentence in the input field.


2. Analysis:

The system checks for lexical ambiguities by comparing input words against a predefined list of ambiguous words.

The system detects structural ambiguities using pattern matching (regular expressions).



3. Output:

The results are displayed with highlighted ambiguities and explanations.

Tooltips provide additional context for ambiguous words.



4. History:
The input is saved in a history list for easy reanalysis.


5. Export:
The analysis can be downloaded as a .txt file.
